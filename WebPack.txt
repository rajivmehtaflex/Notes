using package.json as build tool
using webpack

Webpack in it's simplest form is a module bundler. 
This means that webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

GOALS OF WEBPACK

As stated from the main webpack site, the main goals of creating another module bundler are the abilities to:

Split the dependency tree into chunks loaded on demand
Keep initial loading time low
Every static asset should be able to be a module


Ability to integrate 3rd-party libraries as modules
Ability to customize nearly every part of the module bundler
Suited for big projects
